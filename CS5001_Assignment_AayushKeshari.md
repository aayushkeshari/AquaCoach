# CS5001 Assignment – Team Contract and Individual Capstone Assessment

## Part 1: Team Contract Draft

**Team Contract Draft – Senior Design Project (Fall 2025)**  

**Team Members:**  
- *Name:* Aayush Keshari  
- *Email:* kesharah@mail.uc.edu  
- *UCID:* M15039880  

**Faculty Advisor:**  
- Dr. William Hawkins  

**Meeting Schedule:**  
As a single-member team, I will hold structured weekly check-ins with myself (using a written log and GitHub issues) every Sunday evening to track progress, review milestones, and prepare updates for my advisor. Additionally, I will meet with my faculty advisor at least twice this semester, or more frequently as required, to ensure alignment on project scope and deliverables.  

**Project Focus:**  
The project will focus on developing a **cross-platform hydration tracking mobile application** that calculates personalized water goals, supports multi-beverage logging with hydration efficiency factors, integrates with Apple HealthKit and Google Fit, and provides adaptive reminders to encourage consistent hydration.  

**Roles and Responsibilities:**  
Since I am the sole team member, I will be responsible for all aspects of the project, including requirements analysis, system design, database modeling, mobile app development, API integration, testing, documentation, and presentations. Task prioritization and time management will be handled through GitHub project boards to simulate collaborative workflows and maintain transparency.  

**Acknowledgment:**  
By submitting this draft, I affirm my understanding of the responsibilities and expectations of this senior design project and will seek advisor approval accordingly.

## Part 2: Individual Capstone Assessment

**Paragraph 1 – Introduction**  
My senior design project focuses on developing a cross-platform mobile application that helps individuals maintain healthy hydration habits through personalized daily water goals, beverage logging, and adaptive reminders. The app will leverage integration with Apple HealthKit and Google Fit to collect activity and health data, while emphasizing a privacy-first design that ensures users maintain full control over their personal information. From my academic perspective, this project is both a culmination of my computer science education and an opportunity to demonstrate applied software engineering, data science, and mobile development skills in building a functional product with real-world impact.  

**Paragraph 2 – Curriculum Influence**  
My coursework in the Computer Science program has directly prepared me to undertake this project. Through **CS2028C - Data Structures and Algorithms** and **CS4071 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms**, I gained the ability to design efficient data-handling systems, which will be critical for modeling beverage intake events and optimizing hydration goal calculations. Courses such as **CS4092 – Database Design and Development** provided me with the knowledge to design relational schemas for tracking user input, while **CS4033 - Artificial Intelligence Principles and Applications** introduced me to machine learning concepts that I can apply to adaptive reminders and anomaly detection. Additionally, **CS5153 - Network Security** has reinforced the importance of secure data storage and user privacy, which are fundamental to handling sensitive health-related information responsibly. Collectively, these courses taught me how to design, analyze, and secure software systems, skills that are directly transferable to my senior design project.  

**Paragraph 3 – Co-op Experience Influence**  
My co-op experiences have further shaped the way I will approach this project, equipping me with both technical and professional skills. As a **Data Science Intern at AES Corporation**, I worked with predictive modeling, PyTorch, and SQL pipelines to optimize asset performance, which taught me the value of combining statistical insights with practical decision-making. These skills will support the development of hydration goal algorithms that adapt to real-world variables like activity and environment. As a **Software Development Intern at Great American Insurance Group**, I enhanced application security and system stability while working with enterprise-scale data systems, which honed my skills in code quality, maintainability, and collaborative version control. Together, these experiences provided not only technical expertise but also time management, communication, and problem-solving skills, which will guide me as I take full ownership of the design and implementation process for this project.  

**Paragraph 4 – Motivation and Approach**  
My motivation for this project stems from my interest in building health-focused technology that is both accessible and impactful. I believe hydration tracking is a deceptively simple but meaningful way to help people make healthier choices, and I am excited by the challenge of engineering an app that blends usability, personalization, and security. My preliminary approach involves first designing a transparent hydration goal formula, then implementing robust data models and logging workflows, and finally layering adaptive reminder algorithms to support long-term user engagement. I plan to follow agile-inspired development practices, iterating frequently and maintaining documentation to track progress.  

**Paragraph 5 – Expected Results and Self-Evaluation**  
I expect to deliver a functional, user-friendly mobile application that can reliably log beverages, calculate and track hydration goals, and integrate with major health data platforms. My accomplishments will be measured by successful system integration, usability testing, and advisor evaluation, as well as my ability to demonstrate the app at the Spring CEAS Expo. To self-evaluate, I will define measurable milestones, such as achieving data persistence across sessions, enabling HealthKit/Fit synchronization, and ensuring notification reliability. I will consider my work successful if I can deliver a stable prototype that demonstrates these features, is accessible to a diverse set of users, and aligns with both the technical and ethical standards outlined in the project proposal.
